    "Throughout American history, communities such as the LGBTQ+ community have struggled to advocate for themselves in the midst of challenges from the government, both nationally and on a state-by-state basis. Recently, anti-LGBTQ laws have had a resurgence throughout the country, and this led our group to wonder about the potential affects this has on the mental health of individuals in states especially affected by these laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "Charities such as the Trevor Project, which is commited to helping LGBTQ youth in the midst of crises, have studied negative impacts anti LGBTQ legislation can have on LGBT youth. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This is a good starting point, as it illustrates what the impact of these laws can look like on youth, an especially vernerable population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, certain human rights groups, such as the ACLU <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), understand the importance of making congressional bills that affect human rights available to the public, which will help us in our analysis, as we are able to see which states have put the most effort into restricting LGBTQ rights. \n",

    "We hypothesize that having increased anti-LGBTQ legislation will correlate positively with worsened mental health among LGBTQ youth. Specifically, we hypothesize that aspects like suicide, depression, and physical unwellness (e.g. self-harm) will become more prevalent as more anti-LGBTQ laws are passed in certain states.\n",

As a result, we believe that there may be a quantifiable trend between worsening LGBTQ mental health and proliferation of such laws.\n",
