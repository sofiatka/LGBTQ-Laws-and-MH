Hey team, I'm just letting you know that I left my phone at a friend's house on accident so I wont be able to see messages in the group chat
until I get it back, hopefully by tomorrow morning. I'll delete this note when I get it back and let y'all know. In the meantime, if you need to reach me about project stuff I can still meet
and stuff, but let me know on instagram dms @erik_drumss if you don't mind because otherwise I won't see it
