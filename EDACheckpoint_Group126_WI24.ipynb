    "Throughout American history, the LGBTQ+ community has fought for their rights amidst challenges from the government, both nationally and on a state-by-state basis. In the past six years, there has been a surge in anti-LGBTQ bills, and in 2023, a record number of these bills was introduced throughout the country. These laws come in many different forms, from barriers to accurate ID information to restricting school curriculum. Some states, like Florida, have even criminalized gender-affirming care, which can have dangerous consequences for transgender individuals. This led our group to wonder if surges in this legislation has an effect on the general population in each U.S. state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charities such as the Trevor Project, which is commited to helping LGBTQ youth in the midst of crises, have studied negative impacts anti LGBTQ legislation can have on LGBT youth. In this particular survey <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), 716 LGTBQ youth aged 13-24 were polled about developments in anti-LGBTQ legislation. Notably, 86% of transgender youth reported struggling more with their mental health after discussion of anti-trans bills began circulating. 75% of LGBTQ youth also report experiencing stress and anxiety over threats of violence against LGBTQ spaces, which can be related to the rise in anti-LGBTQ legislation. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This is a good starting point, as it illustrates what the impact of these laws can look like on LGBTQ youth, an especially vulnerable and relevant population for this question. Unfortunately, there is a severe lack of information on LGBTQ mental health data by state. From these surveys, we can only surmise that these laws are not inconsequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Rights Campaign has been tracking the types of legislation each state passes and supports <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). It seems that states with anti-LGBTQ legislation tend to also fall short in other aspects of human rights. For example, Alabama doesn't support transgender healthcare while also failing to provide support for housing, hate crimes, education, and more. Because of this, we believe it's reasonable that anti-LGBTQ legislation may be tied to a broader lack of human rights in some states. Could this effect be seen in the general population?\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain human rights groups, such as the ACLU, report on congressional bills that affect human rights, making this data available to the public <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This will help us in our analysis, as we are able to see which states have put the most effort into restricting LGBTQ rights. Specifically, we can observe which bills have been introduced, passed into law, or defeated in each state. For example, Arizona is currently advancing a bill that will mandate forced outing of LGBTQ students to parents. As it stands, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ bills are advancing in their respective state sessions. Less than 20 have been defeated <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3).\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that there will be a small but significant positive effect between the amount of anti-LGBTQ legislation in each state per year and rate of negative mental health outcomes of the general population in that state. That is, states that attempt to pass more anti-LGBTQ legislation will see worse mental health outcomes in their population over the years since 2020 when controlling for factors such as poverty level and mental health resource accessibility. We hypothesize that this effect will be stronger (more positive) among non-white individuals and youth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people aren't part of the LGBTQ community, so it's reasonable for LGBTQ legislation to not have a very strong effect on the general population. However, anti-LGBTQ legislation reflects a broader anti-human-rights agenda that affects a larger portion of the population. Ideally, we would answer this question for the LGBTQ community itself, but there is an unfortunate lack of data on LGBTQ mental health outcomes by state. Nonetheless, states that are more aggressively anti-LGBTQ might be more aggressively anti-human-rights in general, which could impact the well-being of the general population more than one expects. Additionally, those who are nonwhite may experience racism, which could exacerbate their mental health. Youths may also be more affected by anti-LGBTQ laws, since many anti-LGBTQ laws are directed towards schools."

Using these screens, MHA analyzed the number of people in each state that were at risk of/reporting various mental health issues. From each state, there is data on the number of people per 100K of the population at risk of 1) depression, 2) suicide, 3) PTSD, 4) trauma and 5) psychosis. Most such data are given in float format, since \"per 100K\" implies approximation. One can filter to include different age groups (youth vs. adult), racial groups, and years. \n",

    "Extensive measures had to be taken to wrangle this data, and more wrangling is likely required. Almost all data were objects (strings), so standardizing functions were applied to convert numeric entries (like percents per group and income) to floats or integers. A \"State\" and \"Year\" column were created to make it easier to combine datasets, and the \"State\" column had to extract information from a column that combined state and group-type information (e.g. Alabama Households Estimate). This column requires wrangling as it effectively contains two variables (state + group type) in one, but this may be a bit tricky since the dataset relies on breaking data down by group type, state, and income bracket. One way to resolve this would be to create a separate column for income bracket type and group type. This would decrease the amount of columns while increasing the amount of observations in the data frame, because each group-and-income-bracket pair will becomoe its own observation. The data is currently in a tidy format (see full wrangling process below) but the previously mentioned changes will also be applied."

The lack of clear labels for grouping by state or demographic factors necessitated manual column replacement to render the data more legible. Furthermore, certain variables overlapped, such as the age ranges of 18 to 64 years, 18 to 34 years, and 35 to 64 years, which requires careful preprocessing to ensure suitability for examining mental health vs anti-LGBT laws on a state-by-state basis.

    "There are several ethical issues to consider when observing our data science process. Firstly, our question attempts to generalize the effect of legislation that targets only a subset of a population to the general state population. This requires careful consideration of confounding variables to assure that we are, indeed, getting as close as possible to answering our question for the general population as related to anti-LGBTQ rights laws. So far, we have looked at data on mental health accessibility and poverty, which may be the leading mental health confounders for our research question. We may need to consider more, since we ourselves are biased when imagining what affects mental health. Referring to studies could be a good start to understand what other control factors we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our question is concerned with rather sensitive subject matter. While no personal data is being used (mostly only summary statistics per state and legislation information, which is public), we must still be mindful of the implications of our findings. We do not want to imply that anti-LGBTQ laws are inconsequential should we not find a significant effect on the general population by state. There are people, especially those part of the LGBTQ community, who are being affected personally by these laws. We must also be careful in our discussion when suggesting future steps, should the effect be significant and convincingly strong. In either case, we will discuss the limitations of our data (seen below) and caution against inferring causality from our findings. Since our question is unique to anti-LGBTQ laws, we should not make generalizing assumptions about the overall state of human rights in each state. If we do discuss human rights as whole, we will be clear that we are merely extrapolating from our current findings.\n",
    "\n",

    "The data itself are publicly available and free to download for use. No personal/individual information is involved, and state/census/legislation data is freely available to the public, so data privacy is not a major concern for our research. However, our data may exclude certain populations. The first dataset's Mental Health Risk Screening is generally accessible to everyone, since the mental health screens are taken online by individuals on their own time. However, the accuracy of these screens is of concern, since a single person may not accurately reflect their mental health situation. It is also important to consider that many people who struggle with mental health won't take these screening tests, especially the one provided by MHA. A large subset of the population is likely left out, even after considering 5 million screens. However, because the data are provided in \"per 100K of the state population\" format, we can treat proportions as comparisons between states as opposed to exact measures for a particular state. We may also cross-validate these data with data from other datasets to see if estimates are consistent (during EDA, for instance). These will help mitigate underresponse bias, which is inherent (and unavoidable) to mental health survey data. We will also emphasize in our analysis/discussion that we are only making inferences about *reported* mental health issues, and that we do not have the means to accurately forecast true mental health outcomes. We may not have this issue with legislation and mental health resource data, since these data do not rely on human sampling and have direct access to statistics. Updates may not occur routinely, however, so it is important to consider data may not be as recent as possible. Census poverty may not be perfectly represented, since it relies on only estimating poverty rate from samples. Additionally, poverty rates are not measured routinely; data is missing for 2023 and 2020 contains a 5-year estimate, going beyond our question's timeframe. However, as with mental health, we can use proportions to our advantage and use it is as a comparative metric as opposed to an exact representation of poverty in a state. Nonetheless, we must be mindful about the limitations of our data and emphasize this when we perform analysis. We will be clear about when our data was sourced and clarify that poverty percentages, mental health scores, etc. may not be truly representative of reality. We will emphasize that this is simply the data that was available within a reasonable timeframe from each other and to be mindful of potential disconnects, even if they are only a year or so apart from one another. Alternatively, we can search for more data to fill in the gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big concern is unintended consequences. If it appears that the effect on the general population isn't strong, state legislators may take this as reassurance that only LGBTQ individuals are being harmed by these measures. To avoid this, we will discuss in our analysis (regardless of the results) surveys done by the Trevor Project on the subject of anti-LGBTQ laws and emphasize that, despite what our results may say about the general population, there are individuals being affected either way. That is, we will emphasize that our findings are on a group-level, not on an individual basis, and that group-level findings should not undermine the severity of impact these legislative measures may have on a single person.\n"
